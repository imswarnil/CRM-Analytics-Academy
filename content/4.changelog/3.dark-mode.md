☀️ **Summer ’25 is all about flow**—not Flow the product, flow as in “dashboards that actually feel fun to use.”  
CRM Analytics gets a big UX and data-integration boost this release, with interactive widgets, better table clarity, and recipe + connector upgrades that make large-scale analytics work less painful.

**Highlights for CRM Analytics builders:**

- 🧱 **Repeater widgets with real control**  
  Add custom headers and sort order inside repeater widgets, so list-style layouts (pipelines, top accounts, case queues) look more like proper apps, less like random cards.

- 🎛️ **List & Toggle widgets that actually *do* something**  
  Use List and Toggle widgets to filter and navigate between pages or dashboards—no more “link widget zoo.” Your filters can also act as navigation, so users click less and explore more.

- 🧠 **Table tooltips that explain the metric, not confuse it**  
  Add custom tooltips for table columns so you can tell users *what* “Weighted ACV” or “Health Score” actually means without a separate wiki.

- 🧺 **No-code bucketing in Recipes**  
  Use new bucket definitions directly in the enhanced recipe editor (ranges, operators, labels, filters) with clicks, not code, to categorize data like deal size tiers or risk bands.

- 📬 **Notifications even for read-only users**  
  “Recipes View Only” users can subscribe to recipe notifications—so even non-builders know when data pipelines fail or finish without giving them edit access.

- 🌐 **Cleaner, safer data integrations**  
  Summer ’25 doubles down on external connectivity with:
  - Incremental + periodic full syncs for the Salesforce External Connector  
  - App-level caching to reduce Data Cloud direct query costs and latency  
  - VPC access for Amazon S3, IAM roles for S3/Athena, and OAuth security for Snowflake VPC connections  

**Why it matters for your learners:**  
Summer ’25 is the “dashboard UX + integration polish” release. It’s perfect for lessons where you show:

- How to design app-like CRM Analytics dashboards using List/Toggle/Repeater widgets  
- How to document metrics inside the dashboard with tooltips  
- How to teach data modeling and governance using Recipes + external connectors  

Use this release in your curriculum when you talk about **“Modern CRM Analytics UX + Enterprise Data Integrations.”**
