❄️ **Winter ’25 is the “do stuff directly from the dashboard” release.**  
No more dashboards that just sit there looking pretty—this one leans into actions, exports, and control across CRM Analytics and Data Cloud.

**Core CRM Analytics improvements:**

- 📥 **Download directly from widget action menus**  
  Users can download images or export data straight from an enhanced dashboard widget’s action menu, without opening the Share dialog.

- 🏷️ **Confidentiality labels on exports**  
  Add a “Confidential Information – Do Not Distribute” disclaimer automatically on downloaded images and exported data—great for compliance-heavy teams.

- 🎯 **More precise query filter operators**  
  New filter operators (Does Not Contain, Does Not Start With, Ends With, Does Not End With) give builders tighter control over query logic and filter conditions.

- ⚙️ **Launch Salesforce Flows from dashboards**  
  Launch Flows directly from CRM Analytics dashboard interactions, including autolaunched flows—not just screen flows. Think: create case, update opportunity, trigger approvals from a chart click.

- 📤 **Export from Data Cloud–connected assets**  
  Export query results from Data Cloud data model objects to CSV from CRM Analytics lenses or widgets—making it easier to share Data Cloud-powered insights with downstream tools.

- 💬 **Slack + CRM Analytics, multi-org**  
  Use the CRM Analytics Slack app with multiple orgs so teams can view and share analytics in Slack, right where conversations happen.

**Why it matters for your content:**  

Winter ’25 is your go-to release when you teach:

- **Dashboards as control centers** – triggering flows and processes from CRM Analytics  
- **Compliance & export hygiene** – labelling confidential downloads and controlling exports  
- **Bridging Data Cloud & CRM Analytics** – showing learners how real-time data can still be exported and reused  

Use this release summary in modules like **“Operational Analytics: From Insight to Action.”**
