🌱 **Spring ’25 is the governance + quality control drop** for CRM Analytics.  
Think: fewer “who deleted this?!”, more “don’t worry, we can roll back.” Recipes, dashboards, and external connections all get more transparent and secure.

**Key CRM Analytics upgrades:**

- 🎨 **More accessible donut & stacked bar charts**  
  Donut and stacked bar charts now support improved colour contrast for up to five segments, making key categories easier to read and more accessible.

- 🧾 **Version control for dashboard components**  
  View and restore previous versions of CRM Analytics dashboard components without diving into APIs. It’s basically “mini Git” for dashboard edits.

- 🔍 **Smarter recipe sampling & previewing**  
  Recipes get better data sampling options and richer previews with sorting, searching, and value inspection—making debugging and teaching data prep much easier.

- 🕵️ **Audit trail for dataflow & recipe deletions**  
  The setup audit trail records who deleted a dataflow or recipe and when, so you can finally answer “who broke prod?” with actual evidence.

- 🧑‍🏫 **Read-only recipe access**  
  The “Recipes View Only” permission gives users read-only visibility into recipe definitions and flows—perfect for learners, auditors, and stakeholders who need to understand pipelines without editing them.

- 🔐 **Safer external Salesforce connections + faster syncs**  
  - OAuth 2.0 for external Salesforce connections  
  - Incremental syncs for the Salesforce External Connector and Analytics External Data API  

**Why it matters for your academy:**  

Spring ’25 is perfect for modules around:

- Data governance & auditing in CRM Analytics  
- Safe collaboration between builders and read-only users  
- Best practices for external connections & incremental loads  

Use this release when you run lessons like **“Enterprise-Grade CRM Analytics: Versioning, Permissions & Monitoring.”**
