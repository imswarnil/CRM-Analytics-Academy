Welcome to the **Salesforce CRM Analytics Getting Started** module 👋

This section is your **onboarding ramp**. Before we touch bindings, SAQL, or complex dashboards, you'll understand:

- What Salesforce CRM Analytics actually is
- Why it exists when we already have Salesforce reports & dashboards
- How it evolved from Wave → Einstein Analytics → Tableau CRM → CRM Analytics
- Core terminology you’ll see everywhere (datasets, lenses, recipes, dataflows…)
- How to set up a safe **playground org** and enable CRM Analytics
- How to open Analytics Studio and build your **very first dashboard**

## How this training is structured

- **Short lessons** instead of huge walls of text  
- **Real org mental model** – everything is explained like you’re working in a real Salesforce org
- **Hands-on focus** – most lessons end with “Do this in your org” style checklists
- **Role-aware** – concepts are explained for Admins, Analysts, Consultants, and Devs

## Who this module is for

This Getting Started module is perfect if:

- You are **new to CRM Analytics** and don’t know where to begin
- You’ve seen dashboards but don’t understand **how they are built**
- You’re a Salesforce Admin / BA / RevOps person who wants to move beyond standard reports
- You want a **structured path**, not random YouTube videos

## What you’ll be able to do at the end

By the end of this section, you’ll be able to:

- Explain what Salesforce CRM Analytics is in **one clear sentence**
- Tell someone why Analytics ≠ “just another report”
- Navigate Analytics Studio without fear
- Set up a playground org and **enable CRM Analytics**
- Build a simple dashboard with at least one lens and a filter

Next: let’s properly welcome you and set expectations for your learning journey.
