## Big picture definition

**Salesforce CRM Analytics** is Salesforce’s native analytics platform for:

- Turning raw Salesforce and external data into **datasets**
- Building **interactive dashboards** and visual stories
- Embedding insights directly into **Salesforce records and apps**

Think of it as:

> “A place where you model data, create rich dashboards, and take action – without leaving Salesforce.”

## Where it fits in the ecosystem

CRM Analytics sits **on top of** your:

- Salesforce CRM data (Accounts, Opportunities, Cases, etc.)
- External sources (CSV, databases, Data Cloud, warehouses)
- Business processes (Sales, Service, Marketing, RevOps)

It’s designed for:

- **Sales leadership** – pipeline health, forecasts, performance
- **RevOps / BizOps** – revenue analytics, coverage, segmentation
- **Customer success** – churn risk, health scores, adoption
- **Operations & Support** – backlog, SLA, productivity

## What you can do with it

With CRM Analytics you can:

- Build **multi-object dashboards** that go beyond standard reports
- Join Salesforce data with **external data sources**
- Create **advanced metrics** using SAQL and bindings
- Trigger **Flows, updates, and actions** right from dashboards
- Embed insights in **record pages, consoles, and apps**

## Why this matters for you

If you work in or around Salesforce, CRM Analytics lets you:

- Answer questions that standard reports cannot
- Replace Excel chaos with **central, governed dashboards**
- Give stakeholders **self-serve analytics** with filters & drilldowns
- Tell better **data stories** inside Salesforce, not outside it
