## Welcome 👋

Welcome to your **Salesforce CRM Analytics journey**.

This isn’t just a feature tour. The goal of this training is to help you:

- Think like an **analytics designer**
- Build dashboards that **leaders actually use**
- Connect Salesforce data to **real business questions**

## What you can expect

In this training you’ll find:

- **Plain language explanations** – no unnecessary jargon
- **Real use cases** – pipeline health, revenue performance, customer success
- **Step-by-step flows** – screenshots and checklists where needed (you can add them later)
- **Release-aware content** – we connect key features to Salesforce releases

## How to follow along

1. **Have a Salesforce org ready** (Dev org, sandbox, or trial)
2. Keep this documentation open **next to your org**
3. Treat lessons like a **workshop**, not a blog post
4. Take notes on:
   - Dashboards you want to build
   - Metrics your team cares about
   - Questions leaders keep asking

## Recommended mindset

Think of yourself as:

- Part **translator** (business → data)
- Part **designer** (UX, layout, story)
- Part **engineer** (data, performance, governance)

You don’t need to be perfect at any one of these yet. This training helps you grow all three.
