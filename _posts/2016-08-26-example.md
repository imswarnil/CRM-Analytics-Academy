# What is CRM Analytics?  

Welcome to **CRM Analytics Academy** 👋 — if you’ve landed here, chances are you’re curious about Salesforce’s analytics platform that everyone keeps renaming. Don’t worry, you’re not alone.  

CRM Analytics is **Salesforce’s advanced analytics and business intelligence (BI) platform**. It helps businesses go beyond standard reports and dashboards, enabling users to connect, prepare, and visualize data from Salesforce and external sources (like Snowflake, AWS Redshift, or plain CSVs).  

In simple words: **CRM Analytics turns your business data into insights, predictions, and visual stories — all inside Salesforce.**

## 💡 Why CRM Analytics Exists
Salesforce Reports & Dashboards are great for quick snapshots, but as businesses grow, they need:
- **Deeper insights** (slice and dice across multiple datasets)  
- **Advanced modeling** (dataflows, recipes, transformations)  
- **Predictive power** (AI/ML insights with Einstein Discovery)  
- **Scalability** (millions of rows, external integrations)  

That’s where CRM Analytics steps in.

## 🌀 The Name Change Saga
This platform has had more costume changes than a Bollywood hero:  

1. **Wave Analytics (2014)** → Salesforce’s first attempt at BI.  
2. **Einstein Analytics (2016)** → Infused with Salesforce’s AI brand.  
3. **Tableau CRM (2020)** → After Salesforce acquired Tableau, they rebranded.  
4. **CRM Analytics (2022)** → Current name. Salesforce chose this to unify the platform’s identity as *the analytics layer for CRM*.  

👉 Moral of the story: whether you heard *Wave*, *Einstein*, or *Tableau CRM*, they all refer to the **same core platform** we now call **CRM Analytics**【Salesforce Docs†source】.
